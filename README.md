# Tailwindcss and ReactJS Hello World using Webpack and SWC

Hello World test project for trying out [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)

This is just a sample application utilising Webpack, SWC and Tailwind.

## Info

Most of the webpack configuration is inspired by the ejected configuration from CRA.

The inclusion in SWC as the compiler and minifier, so this now uses the `swc-loader` for the typescript files.

## Getting started

1. Clone repo
2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Develop
```
npm run start
```

This repository uses Tailwind v3 so by default Tailwind JIT is enabled, hence only used styles are output.
